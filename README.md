# Project description 


This is my third milestone project for Code Institute. Hangman game is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes representing each letter of the word. If the suggested letter is in the word, it is written down, If guessed wrong it will progress the hangman picture and mark the used letter. This process is repeated until the hangman is completed or the user guesses the word.

# Validation

* Originally meant to validate the code at pep8online.com, however the site was down.

   * Checked in slack community about the issue and found an alternative.
   
1. Run the command pip3 install pycodestyle  Note that this extension may already be installed, in which case this command will do nothing.
2. In your workspace, press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).
3. Type the word linter into the search bar that appears, and click on Python: Select Linter from the filtered results (image 1).
4. Select pycodestyle from the list.
5. PEP8 errors will now be underlined in red, as well as being listed in the PROBLEMS tab beside your terminal.

* No errors was found

# Deployment 

* The project was deployed using Code Institutes mock terminal for Heroku.
  * Steps to deploy:
1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. Ensure the Procfile is in place.
3. requirements.txt can be left empty as this project does not use any external libraries.
4. Create a new app in Heroku.
5. Select "New" and "Create new app".
6. Name the new app and click "Create new app".
7. In "Settings" select "BuildPack" and select Python and Node.js. (Python must be at the top of the list).
8. Whilst still in "Settings", click "Reveal Config Vars" and input the folloing. KEY: PORT, VALUE: 8000.  
9. Nothing else is needed here as this project does not have any sensitive files.
10. Click on "Deploy" and select your deploy method and repository.
11. Click "Connect" on selected repository.
12. Either choose "Enable Automatic Deploys" or "Deploy Branch" in the manual deploy section.
13. Heroku will now deploy the site.
